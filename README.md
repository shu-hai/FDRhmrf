# FDRhmrf

This package is designed for the false discovery rate (FDR) controlling procedure proposed in [1]. This FDR procedure is based on the two-parameter Ising model (a classical hidden Markov random field) and the local index of significance (LIS; [2,3]), which aims to minimize the false nondiscovery rate (FNR) while controlling FDR at a given level especially for 3D spatial data, e.g., neuroimaging data.

This package is coded in C++, and can be called from Matlab by MEX. Examples are provided, and please see [README.pdf](https://github.com/shu-hai/FDRhmrf/blob/master/README.pdf) for details.
