# FDRhmrf

This package is designed for the false discovery rate (FDR) controlling procedure proposed in [1]. This FDR procedure is based on two-parameter Ising model (a classical hidden Markov random field) and the local index of significance (LIS; [2,3]), which aims to minimize the false nondiscovery rate (FNR) while controlling FDR at a given level for 3D spatial data, e.g. neuroimaging data.
